* Binary Search
* Reverse Binary Search
* Order unknown Reverse/Forward MixSort B.S.
* 1st & Last  of an element
* count of elem in a sorted array
*** number of  times array to rotated
* find an element in rotated sorted
* Searchinig in an nearly sorted array
* floar/ceil of an element
* find next next alphabetic letter after given target 
* find index of an element in an infinite sorted array
* find 1st occurance targeted element's index of an element in an infinite sorted array* 
* min difference elem in sorted array
* Concept: B.S. on answer (Important) => Peak Element(High Level Concept)
* bitomic array => Find max elem
* Search & find elem  in a  bitomic array
* Search in row vice to coloum vice sorted 2D-array
*** allocate numb of min # of pages (NOT COMPLETED)
* find elem in sorted array apear only once
*** in an any problem if word Sorted is mention its clue we need to use Binary Search;
*** if array is sorted By Binary Search time complexity will reduce
